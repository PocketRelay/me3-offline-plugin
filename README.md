## ‚ùî What

This is a plugin which tricks the game into thinking you have an internet connection. This is useful if you're trying to
play an unofficial server while not being connected to the internet. Because the game checks whether you're actually connected
to Wifi/Ethernet of some sort when you go into multiplayer. So if you try and play multiplayer when you're not connected to a network even with Pocket Relay it won't work and the game shows you the following screen:

This plugin tricks the game into thinking you're still connected to a network allowing you to play multiplayer completely offline (As long as you've got your own server like Pocket Relay running)
